The output of the various checking tools should be paid attention to although checkstyle is a little "aggressive".

Good set of tests. Well implemented. 

In SampleableListImpl avoid "Magic numbers" if at all possible "i = i + 2" - just a small point

Reference the interface documentation in the implementations

In ArrayList use constants where appropriate

private int INITIAL_LENGTH = 10; 

static and final 

Include ordinary comments where appropriate in the code

Perhaps avoid multiple decs on a single line as these can easily be missed by the reader

private Node head = new Node(), tail = head; (LinkedList)

Excellent effort
